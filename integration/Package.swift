import PackageDescription

// A separate package on purpose. The suite in ../Tests exercises this working
// tree; this one exercises the artifact a stranger resolves, which is the only
// way to notice a tag that never landed, a product a consumer cannot name, or a
// build plugin that refuses to run for anyone but us.
//
// SwiftPM resolves a version from a git TAG, so before the first tag there is
// nothing published to test and `scripts/run.sh` skips with a reason.
//
// VPNDETECTION_SDK_LOCAL_PATH swaps in a checkout, which is how this suite's own
// logic is verified while no tag exists yet. It is deliberately not the default,
// and it cannot pass unnoticed: a path dependency writes no `Package.resolved`
// entry, and `scripts/run.sh` refuses to call a run without one an integration
// pass. The directory has to be named `sdk-swift`, because SwiftPM takes a local
// package's identity from its directory name and the product below names it.
