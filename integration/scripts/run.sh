# Runs the integration suite against the package as PUBLISHED, which is the one
# thing the suite in ../Tests cannot check: it builds this working tree, so it
# stays green through a tag that never landed, a product a consumer cannot name,
# or a build plugin that only ever ran for us.
#
#   ./scripts/run.sh
#   SDK_LOCAL_PATH=.. ./scripts/run.sh    # verify this suite before a tag exists
#
# Two conditions make a run meaningless rather than failing, and each one skips
# with a reason instead:
#
#   1. Nothing published satisfies the declared range. SwiftPM resolves a
#      version from a git TAG, so before the first release there is no artifact.
#   2. A tier's staging key is missing or EMPTY. The unauthenticated tests still
#      run, and each tier without a key skips from inside the suite, so the skip
#      and its reason land in the test output rather than only here.
#
# Swift runs natively when the toolchain is present and inside the official
# image otherwise, so a dev box with no Swift and a CI container both use this
# one entry point.
